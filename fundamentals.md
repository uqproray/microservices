### microservice-based architecture

- small services with less responsibilities

- more independence for each service

- sometimes data repetition happens because each service can use data in its own way

- each service usually has its own database

- tolerates failures better

- each service must be created, identified as an entity thinking about business rules

- can communicate: synchronous or asynchronous

- you can use many different solutions to communicate between microservices..
